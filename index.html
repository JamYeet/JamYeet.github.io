            <p id="about_text">Hey, I’m James Chen (He/Him), a Computer Science (Honours) student at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS), majoring in Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics. I’m also pursuing a sub-major in Amazon Web Services (AWS) Industry, with a focus on cloud computing and scalable architectures.</p>
            <p id="about_text"> I am eagerly looking forward to furthering my knowledge, gaining practical experience through real-world projects, and applying my skills in professional settings. What excites me most is the opportunity to apply what I’ve learned to real-world projects. Whether I’m solving problems through code, building web apps,
                 or exploring the intersection between AI and cloud computing, I’m driven by curiosity and the desire to create meaningful solutions.</p>
                 <p id="about_text">I’m currently seeking opportunities to gain professional experience through internships or collaborations, particularly in software development and game technology—fields where I can grow, contribute, and bring my ideas to life.</p>
