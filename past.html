            <p id="mypast">Hi, I'm James, a Computer Science (Honours) student at the University of Technology Sydney, majoring in Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics. I'm passionate about developing innovative solutions through coding and data analysis.</p>
            <p id="mypast">Currently, I'm delving into Java, focusing on problems involving arrays and linked lists, and applying for internships to gain hands-on experience in the tech industry. In my free time, I like playing video games, practising my coding abilities on LeetCode and develop personal projects like my portfolio website, where I showcase my skills and develop real-life applicable programs I can be proud of.</p>
            <p id="mypast">I am currently using Git and will set up my projects on GitHub Repositories like this one. I'm also keen on building my reputation in the tech community by sharing my projects and collaborating with others.</p>
            <p id="mypast">My technical skills include Java, Python, and web development (HTML & CSS). I am familar with GDScript as I have developed a complete functional Minesweeper game the year before and after graduating High School. My goal is to leverage my knowledge in AI and data analytics to create impactful technology solutions in the tech world.</p>
            <p id="mypast">So feel free to connect with me to discuss potential collaborations, internships, or any exciting tech ideas!</p>
