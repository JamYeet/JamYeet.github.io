            <p id="mypast">During high school, I studied five subjects for the HSC. These subjects were Physics, Advanced Mathematics, Standard English, Software Design & Development (SDD), and Graphic Design. Totalling ten units and qualifying for an HSC. Initially, I was also studying Engineering. However, it was dropped because of the lack of teachers for that subject. The most enjoyable subject out of the five would have been Software Design & Development. The hardest subject would have to be Physics.</p>
