            <p id="mypast">Hi, I'm James, a Computer Science (Honours) student at the University of Technology Sydney, majoring in Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics. I'm deeply passionate about building meaningful, creative, and technically challenging software—especially in the world of video game development.</p>
            <p id="mypast">Some of my projects includes a fully functional Minesweeper game built in Godot, a responsive portfolio website, and various interactive game systems in Roblox, where I'm now learning more about multiplayer architecture and monetization features.</p>
            <p id="mypast">I use Git for version control and maintain my projects on GitHub, aiming to grow my presence in the dev community by sharing my work and collaborating with others. My technical toolkit includes Java, Python, HTML/CSS, SQL, Lua, and GDScript, and I'm always exploring new tools and frameworks to expand my skill set.</p>
            <p id="mypast">My technical skills include Java, Python, and web development (HTML & CSS). I am familar with GDScript as I have developed a complete functional Minesweeper game the year after graduating High School. My goal is to leverage my knowledge in AI and data analytics to create impactful technology solutions in the tech world.</p>
            <p id="mypast">My ultimate goal is to merge my love for AI, game mechanics, and user experience into creating immersive, player-focused software. Riot Games is one of my biggest inspirations in that journey.</p>
