            <h2>Overall Design/Reflection</h2>
            <p>In the makings of this website, I have chosen a minimalistic approach as I resonate with the philosophy: <span class = "less_is_more_quote">"Less is more"</span>. Every choice of placement and colour scheme has been meticulously chosen and thoughtfully placed to create a website that is pleasing to look at, in something simple.</p>

            <h2>Technical (HTML)</h2>
            <p><b>Website Structure</b></p>
            <p>The structure of the website consists of four webpages and one css stylesheet:</p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Filename</th>
                    <th>Title</th>
                    <th>File Type</th>
                    <th>Description</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>index.html</td>
                    <td>Home</td>
                    <td>HTML</td>
                    <td>The homepage of the website</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>past.html</td>
                    <td>My Past</td>
                    <td>HTML</td>
                    <td>The description of my past</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>future.html</td>
                    <td>My Future</td>
                    <td>HTML</td>
                    <td>The description of my future plans</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>comments.html</td>
                    <td>Comments</td>
                    <td>HTML</td>
                    <td>Comments, reflection and explanation of the website</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>websystems.css</td>
                    <td>N/A</td>
                    <td>CSS</td>
                    <td>The stylesheet that positions and styles the website</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p><b>HTML Structure</b></p>
            <p>The HTML files from the website you see right now consist of classes, IDs, and divs of the titles, paragraphs, tables, images, headers, and footers. The &lt;div&gt; for this website was used to separate and adequately call different sections of the webpage, such as an image container or the comments section. From these divs, positioning of HTML elements was made possible as I used styles in the CSS stylesheet such as margins, borders, max-width, padding, etc.</p>
            <img src="./images/structure.png" alt="structureimg" id="structureimg">
            <p>The main sections of the webpage are shown below:
            <ol>  
                <li class = "structure_points">Header</li>

                <p>The header is located at the top of every page on this website, and it consists of my initials as a logo of the website located at the top left and the menu located at the top right. These elements are defined under &lt;header&gt; class and were referenced to style in the CSS stylesheet.</p>
                <p>In the HTML files, the &lt;header&gt; class was a parent class to #initals and #menu, meaning by positioning the &lt;header&gt; at the top of the page, the child classes would inherit these margins and be positioned automatically at the top. The initials utilised a &lt;h3&gt; tag and were margined to be placed on the left of the footer. The menu on the top right is an unordered list of hyperlinks that would direct the user to different web pages on the website. As shown at the top right, the menu has "Home", "My Past", "My Future", and "Comments" as titles of the hyperlinks. As mentioned, the menu is a list; however, its elements are not placed vertically. This is because, in the CSS style sheet, the list style has been removed to create that horizontal list placement as shown instead of the vertical list you would see in a default list.</p>
                
                    <li class = "structure_points">Body</li>

                    <p>The body is located between the header and footer of every page on this website. Each page's body mainly consists of an image, a title and a paragraph of what the page is about. For example, the My Past page's body elements would be an &lt;img&gt;, &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h3&gt;, and &lt;p&gt; are defined under &lt;body&gt; in the HTML files.</p>
                    <ul class = "structure_subpoints">
                        <li>Title</li>
                        <p>In all four pages, there is a &lt;h1 id = title&gt; that informs the user what that web page is going to be about. For example, on the My Past page, the title will be "My Past". In the four HTML files, each title is positioned and margined, and the font family and sizes are exactly the same. Hence, only one ID is used for the title instead of four different ones. In the stylesheet, each title is italicised, positioned in the middle of the user's screen, and followed by a 25% width line to clearly segregate the title from the image and main paragraphs.<p>
                        <li>Images, subtitle, and paragraph</li>
                        <p>The text in the footer utilises &lt;p&gt; tags for the purpose of making the text size small. The text was placed and aligned in the centre of the page, and the chosen background colour was a simple dark grey [rgb(109, 108, 108)] to indicate the end of the page.</p>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <li class = "structure_points">Footer</li>
                    <p>The footer is located at the bottom of every page, and it consists of the course's name and ID, university and my initials as the creator of the website.</p>
                    <p>The text in the footer utilises &lt;p&gt; tags for the purpose of making the text size small. text were placed and alligned in the center of the page and the chosen background-color was a simple dark grey [rgb(109, 108, 108)] to indicate the end of the page.</p>
                </ol>

                <h2>Asesthetics (CSS)</h2>
            
                <p>Nowadays, modern websites seem to take the minimalistic approach when it comes to website aesthetics, as having more elements could be more overwhelming and have a higher risk when it comes to accessibility as more factors come into play. This website attempts to be no different as it also takes a minimalistic approach when it comes to its CSS styles.</p>
            
                <p><b>Colour Scheme</b></p> 
            
                <p>The colors I chose for the website are primarily black and very light pink, with accents of white and yellow. The use of light pink adds a touch of warmth and friendliness, making the website inviting and approachable. The accents of white contribute to a clean and open design, while hints of yellow add a dash of optimism and creativity. The black and light pink colours were done using simple CSS styles such as &lt;color&gt; &lt;font-color&gt; &lt;background-color&gt; as shown on the website, having a light pink background colour and black text. The small hints of white and yellow were derived from the images used in each webpage to give the website a little more light but not too much to overwhelm the main colours. This can be seen in the Home page images with the wings and cat picture. This simple colour palette is light and not heavy, appearing more pleasing to the user's eyes, adding a feeling of simplicity to the website. The use of borders has also been limited to fit the minimalistic approach, as I initially thought of wrapping the menu bar in black borders.</p>
                <img src="./images/colourpalette.png" alt="colourpalette1" id="colourpalette">
                <p><b>Font</b></p> 
            
                <p>The two font styles I have carefully chosen for this website are 'Times New Roman' and 'Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif'. The San-serif font style was used in the website menu located at the top right. The reason for this choice was that the sans-serif font is commonly known as an easy-to-read font, allowing users to easily distinguish the website's menu bar and focus on the main content of the webpage. As for the rest of the website, the font style used was Times New Roman. This font was chosen for the rest of the website as the font known for its popularity, and is highly legible at any practical font size, allowing users to be able to read the website's content at different resolutions and font sizes </p>
            
                <p><b>Interactivity</b></p> 
            
                <p>The website also provides real-time feedback to the user whenever they hover over the menu's hyperlinks. Through the use of li a: hover{} in CSS, whenever the user hovers over any of the hyperlinks on the menu, the hyperlinks become italicised and change into a darker red. This provides engagement and positive website responsiveness to the user.</p>
                
                <img src="./images/hoverexampleimg.png" alt="hoverexampleimg" id="hoverexampleimg">

                <p><b>Structure</b></p>
                <p>The structure of the website is mostly positioned in the middle and expands vertically. This makes the text easier to look at on both mobile devices and computers, as most of the text is read as you scroll down, preventing users from getting tired when reading left to right. Since most of the elements are in the middle, it makes it easier for the website to be accessible to mobile users.</p> 
            
                <hr>

                <h2>Accessibility</h2>
                
                <p><b>Inclusivity in sound, structure and colour</b></p>
                <p>The structure of the website in HTML is internally structured correctly in &lt;div&gt;'s; and &lt;p&gt;'s', which enables opportunities for screen reading and text-to-speech software such as browser extensions to scan the website's paragraph with no issue, allowing users that are visually impaired to use the website with full functionality. Alt text has also been assigned to every image on this website, which is essential as when images are disabled or when screen readers are used, alt text will be displayed instead.</p>
                <p>The chosen colours of the website are very light, allowing users to easily navigate the website without their eyes getting sore. Additional features such as hovering over the hyperlinks will make the text italicised, indicating that the website is registering the mouse properly over the links, informing colour-blind users that the website is functioning as intended.</p>
                <p>The website was designed without sound effects, meaning features will not have any impact from the use of sound.</p>
                
                <p><b>Font Size</b></p>
                <p>The font sizes of the sans-serif and Times New Roman are appropriately sized for the screen so that users are able to read the text comfortably. The font sizes of titles are set to default, which makes it reasonably large, with a font size of 34px. General paragraphs are easily read as their font sizes are 16px. The website is also accessible on mobile devices, which automatically enlarges the text to fit the screen so the text is reasonably sized for users to read easily without having to squint at pc font sizes.</p>

                <p><b>Font Spacing</b></p>
                <p>Font spacing has been appropriately set according to the WAI guidelines. Having small text too close together can make the text harder to read, which is why having appropriate font spacing is essential. This has been applied in the footer section of the website with a letter spacing of 1.92px (16px * 0.2).</p>
            
                <p><b>Font Selection</b></p>
                <p> Fonts selected for this website are Sans-serif and Times New Roman. As mentioned in Aesthetics, the Sans serif font was used in the menu bar so that users can easily distinguish the hyperlinks and decide where they want to be directed. Times New Roman is a more popular font and is more used, allowing users to easily recognise the font style and be at ease when they read longer texts such as the My Past or My Future web pages.</p>
