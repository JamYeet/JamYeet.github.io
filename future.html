            <p id="myfuture">In about two years, I will graduate from UTS with a degree in Computer Science (Honours). I will look for a computer science-related job or an internship/cadetship as a start. During that process, I will get into other job industries, such as retail, to build up my work experience and my resume. The end goal of this job search would be a good-paying computer science job that can be worked at home so I'm never too distanced from family. When I do reach that ideal job and am financially stable, in my spare time, maybe I will study and learn other ways to make money at home, such as dropshipping.</p>
